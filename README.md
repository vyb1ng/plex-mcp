# Plex MCP Server
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@vyb1ng/plex-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@vyb1ng/plex-mcp)

Search and manage your Plex media libraries with Claude. Actively developed by Claude and a nerdy human who mostly uses Plex for auditory delights and wanted to see how much could be accomplished without knowing much about what they're doing. Results may vary, but probably in a good way.

## Quick Start

### Install via Smithery (Recommended)
```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @vyb1ng/plex-mcp --client claude
```

### Manual Setup for Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["plex-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PLEX_URL": "http://your-plex-server:32400"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

**Option 1: OAuth (Recommended)**
- Use the `authenticate_plex` tool to get a login URL
- Sign in through your browser

**Option 2: Static Token**
- Add `"PLEX_TOKEN": "your_token"` to the env section
- Get your token from [Plex Support](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)

**Note:** Replace `your-plex-server:32400` with your actual Plex server address and port.

## What You Can Do
